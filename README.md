## Adaptive time step algorithm for Brownian dynamics (BD)

### Summary

The code implements the rejection sampling with memory (RSwM3)
adaptive time step Brownian dynamics (BD) algorithm ('ALGORITHM 2') from 
[Sammüller and Schmidt, J. Chem. Phys. 155, 134107 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0062396), 
using embedded Heun–Euler trial steps.  The implementation is for
Brownian motion of a single particle in three dimensions, and is
intended to be partly pedagogical, as well as providing a code
repository for some simulations related to particle trapping by
diffusiophoresis (DP).

Equation numbers in the code refer to the above paper.

The algorithm is split off into `adaptive_bd.py` and drivers for the
following test cases are given:
* pure Brownian motion (free diffusion);
* Brownian motion in a linear drift field;
* Brownian motion in a harmonic trap (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck problem);
* bounded Brownian motion in a linear drift field (Chandrasekhar's sedimentation problem);
* Brownian motion with a non-potential drift field (DP trapping).

In the initial commit, the code `lsjet_adaptive.py` contains both the
algorithm and an application to DP trapping in the vicinity of slender
pipette injecting a salt solution.
